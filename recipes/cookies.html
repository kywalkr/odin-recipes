    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white, oat, or spelt flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar, unrefined if desired</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar or coconut sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chocolate chips</li>
        <li>2 tbsp milk of choice, plus more if needed</li>
        <li>2 tbsp oil or melted vegan butter</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all dry ingredients in a bowl, then stir in wet to form a dough â€“ it will be dry at first, so keep stirring until a cookie-dough texture is achieved. If needed, add 1-2 tbsp extra milk of choice.</li>
        <li>Form into one big ball, then either refrigerate at least 2 hours or freeze until the dough is cold.</li>
        <li>Once dough is chilled, preheat oven to 325 F.</li>
        <li>Form dough balls, and place on a greased baking tray, leaving enough room between cookies for them to spread. Bake 11 minutes on the center rack.</li>
        <li>Let them cool on the baking tray 10 minutes before touching, during which time they will firm up.</li>
    </ol>
